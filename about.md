Hi! I'm Jay.

I'm a final-year Electrical & Electronic Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Bristol who, while not programming or making games and/or websites, is also heavily involved with the Bristol University Music Society, Music Theatre Bristol, A Cappella Society, and Art Society.

Additionally I am also an aspiring sound designer & a music technology engineer, looking to combine the arts of musical performance & composition with engineering practices. This means I also have a bunch of synthesisers in my dorm.

Basically, I'm a rockstar-wannabe. Who isn't really a rockstar.

I also don't have a synthesiser in my room. Yet.

That's it from me for now! Stay tuned for more!

I might also add my profile image here too.

God, it's 2AM. I need to go decaf.
