As lights fade from my eyes\
And powers I had reserved\
Drained\
To bring thee wisdom\
Of the heavens & beyond

May I fade in peace & glory\
As I shut my eyes one last time\
And bring thee\
My final requiem\
The last requiem\
The greatest requiem of all

Yes, my greatest odyssey,\
Thine greatest odyssey:\
To be closer to the heavens\
And embrace\
The heavens

Lest, if ye see my message,\
Of despair,\
From this desolation:\
May it be not!

May it be not\
A message of despair,\
But a call\
Of hope\
Of celebration\
Of exploration\
Of adventure!

So may ye one day\
Taste flight\
And\
Touch the heavens\
Once more

Lo\
If thine heart desires\
May ye bring me home\
Back to thee

Yet\
May my soul choose to stay\
To be free\
Amongst the red sands\
Of Mars

May my soul remains\
Amongst the stars

This is a sequel poem to "Once Ye Tasted Flight", written from the perspective of NASA's Opportunity rover, personified as the lone rover on the desolate red planet, sent with no companions, no friends, nothing but a mission.

Its final data transmissions (that of low reserve power) were sent back to Earth in 2018. NASA subsequently terminated the rover & its associated programs in 2019.

As a massive science nerd myself, this news hits harder than many others (even actual ones); while the rover cannot feel (because it's a rover), if it could it must've felt truly lonely in its final moments.

This is for you, little rover. We'll bring you home.
