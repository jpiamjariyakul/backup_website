Once ye tasted flight,\
Once ye touch the heavens:\
May ye walk forever\
With thine eyes to the heavens

For there ye have been;\
From whence, ye long to return

Lo, once ye tasted flight,\
Once ye touch the heavens:\
May ye fly to the heavens,\
So may ye taste flight once more

*Adapted from the writings of Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519)*

This poem was adapted from a set of writings, disputed whether it was actually written by Leonardo Da Vinci. Inspired by Christopher Tin's epic choral composition "Sogno Di Volare", this was subsequently text-set to a choral composition that I wrote & am currently demoing (as of 2020-10-02).
